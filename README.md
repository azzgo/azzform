> A Form Designer of Vue Version

This is a Vue Version Form Designer. It may be a good starter to be part of your low code Soluton


## Idea

It Inspired by Alibaba [x-render](https://github.com/alibaba/x-render), based with [JSON SCHEMA](https://json-schema.org/), to describe form data structure and UI layout. With JSON SCHEMA, other Programe(like API Server) can easy know your data structure and how to do some basic validate.
